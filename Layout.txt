The Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes, MAST, was founded in 1997 as a permanent home for HST and IUE data. 
Today it spans over 40 years worth of observations, primarily focused on ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared data. MAST hosts imaging, spectroscopic, and timeseries observations, in addition to source catalogs and user-contributed data in the form of High-Level Science Products (HLSP).
